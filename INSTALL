# Rth Installation

Below, the installation directory is ~/R; change as desired.

Download the package to a directory Rth (can delete after installation), so that
for example the R code is now in Rth/R.

Then do one of the following, according to the desired backend.

## Thrust
If your system has a working CUDA 4.0 or above installation, you may safely skip
this section.

You will need a copy of the Thrust template library to use any of the Rth
backends. To install Thrust, please refer to the Quick Start Guide in the Thrust
Wiki (https://github.com/thrust/thrust/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide).

Pay close attention to the warning not to install Thrust to the standard *nix
include directory /usr/local/include/.

### Setting the Thrust path for compilation
Rth accepts the configure argument thrust-home, which defaults to
/usr/local/cuda/include/.

If your Thrust installation path differs from the default, simply pass
--with-thrust-home=/your/thrust/path/ in the --configure-args during the install
phase.

## OpenMP

Assuming you have an OpenMP-compatible C++ compiler (on a Mac, install the
OpenMP-compatible version of clang):

    R CMD INSTALL -l ~/R path/to/Rth --configure-args="--with-backend=OPENMP"

## Intel Thread Building Blocks

    R CMD INSTALL -l ~/R path/to/Rth \
        --configure-args="--with-backend=TBB --with-tbb-incdir=$TBBINC --with-tbb-libdir=$TBBLIB"

## CUDA

    R CMD INSTALL -l ~/R path/to/Rth --configure-args="--with-backend=CUDA"
