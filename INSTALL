# Rth Installation

Below, the installation directory is ~/R; change as desired.  

Download the package to a directory Rth (can delete after installation), so that for example the R code is now in Rth/R.  

Change directory to Rth, and run one of the following, depending on desired backend:

./configure --with-backend=TBB --with-tbb-incdir=$TBBINC --with-tbb-libdir=$TBBLIB

./configure --with-backend=OPENMP

./configure --with-backend=CUDA

Then change back up to the directory

Then do one of the following, according to the desired backend.

## OpenMP

Assuming you have an OpenMP-compatible C++ compiler (on a Mac, install the OpenMP-compatible version of clang):


    cd Rth
    ./configure --with-backend=OPENMP
    cd ..
    R CMD INSTALL -l ~/R Rth

## Intel Thread Building Blocks


    cd Rth
    ./configure --with-backend=TBB --with-tbb-incdir=$TBBINC --with-tbb-libdir=$TBBLIB
    cd ..
    R CMD INSTALL -l ~/R Rth



## CUDA

    cd Rth
    ./configure --with-backend=CUDA
    cd ..
    R CMD INSTALL -l ~/R Rth
