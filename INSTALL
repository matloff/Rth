# Rth Installation

Below, the installation directory is ~/R; change as desired.  

Download the package to a directory Rth (can delete after installation),
so that for example the R code is now in Rth/R.  Then do one of the following, according to the desired backend.

## OpenMP

Assuming you have an OpenMP-compatible C++ compiler (on a Mac, install the OpenMP-compatible version of clang):

    R CMD INSTALL -l ~/R Rth \
      --configure-args="--with-backend=OPENMP"



## Intel Thread Building Blocks


    R CMD INSTALL -l ~/R Rth \
      --configure-args="--with-backend=TBB \
      --with-tbb-incdir=$TBBINC --with-tbb-libdir=$TBBLIB"



## CUDA

    R CMD INSTALL -l ~/R Rth \
      --configure-args="--with-backend=CUDA"
