Tests for Rth are heavily dependent on which backend you would like to use. As a
result, it is required that Rth is built and installed in order to run these
tests.

To run the tests, execute Rscript testthat.R.
Ensure the Rth package is either accessable at the root level, or via
R_LIBS_USER. Alternatively, you may change the library location in testthat.R to
load from a specific location.

These tests are intended for internal use by developers for more confidence that
all functions work, and will continue to work as more are developed. The tests
are not inteded to be run on CRAN or by R CMD check.
