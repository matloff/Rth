\title{Flexible parallel computing from R, on multicore machines and GPUs.}
\description{
A collection of R wrappers to C++ functions written in the Thrust
environment.  Since the latter can be configured for execution either on
multicore systems or on graphics processing units (GPUs), the same code
works on both types of platforms.
}
\details{
R programmers may use these functions without knowing how to program in C++,
and without knowledge of the underlying parallel hardware.
